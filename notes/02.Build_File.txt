ANT BUILD FILE :
----------------

The XML element project has three attributes :

Attributes	Description
---------------------------------------------------
name		The Name of the project. (Optional)

default		The default target for the build script. A project may contain any number of targets. 
		This attribute specifies which target should be considered as the default. (Mandatory)

basedir		The base directory (or) the root folder for the project. (Optional)

A target is a collection of tasks that you want to run as one unit. 
In our example, we have a simple target to provide an informational message to the user.

If we have multiple targets in a project we can't build all at a time. In such case we need to mention our
default target in the defaults or else we need to set the value of defaults to "all" and need to mention
the target name while running the build.

For ex: I have two targets in my project say "infoenv" and "infoproj". If i want to run a specific target 
then i need to do like below.

# ant -f test2.xml infoenv
# ant -f test2.xml infoproj

Targets can have dependencies on other targets. For example, a deploy target may have a dependency on 
the package target, the package target may have a dependency on the compile target and so forth. 
Dependencies are denoted using the depends attribute.

The target element has the following attributes:

Attributes	Description
-------------------------------------------------
name		The name of the target (Required)

depends		Comma separated list of all targets that this target depends on. (Optional)

description	A short description of the target. (optional)

if		Allows the execution of a target based on the trueness of a conditional attribute. (optional)

unless		Adds the target to the dependency list of the specified Extension Point. 
		An Extension Point is similar to a target, but it does not have any tasks. (Optional)
To run the ant build file, open up command prompt and navigate to the folder where the build.xml resides, 
and type ant info. You could also type ant instead. Both will work, because info is the default target in the build file.
Or else you can change the name to some another apart from using build.xml. For example I am using this as test1.xml.
In such case we need to run as follows.
# ant -f test1.xml
