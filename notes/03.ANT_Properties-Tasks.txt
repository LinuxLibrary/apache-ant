# ANT PROPERTIES :
------------------

Ant uses the property element which allows you to specify properties.
This allows the properties to be changed from one build to another or from one environment to another.

By default, Ant provides the following pre-defined properties that can be used in the build file:
Properties			Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ant.file			The full location of the build file.
ant.version			The version of the Apache Ant installation.
basedir				The basedir of the build, as specified in the basedir attribute of the project element.
ant.java.version		The version of the JDK that is used by Ant.
ant.project.name		The name of the project, as specified in the name atrribute of the project element.
ant.project.default-target	The default target of the current project.
ant.project.invoked-targets	Comma separated list of the targets that were invoked in the current project.
ant.core.lib			The full location of the Ant jar file.
ant.home			The home directory of Ant installation.
ant.library.dir			The home directory for Ant library files - typically ANT_HOME/lib folder.

Ant also makes the system properties (Example: file.separator) available to the build file.

In addition to the above, the user can define additional properties using the property element. 
The following example shows how to define a property called sitename:
